\section{Preparing an Anonymous Submission}

\section{Introduction}

We use modified ideas from echo hiding \cite{gruhl1996echo}.

There are myriad techniques for generative audio instrument training (todo: citations), but to show the general applicability of this technique in a replicable way, we pick three open models with fundamentally different approaches whose code is readily available online: RAVE \cite{caillon2021rave} Dance Diffusion \cite{evans2022dancediffusion}, and differentiable digital signal processing (DDSP) \cite{engelddsp}.  Each model is trained on audio only, as opposed to those also involving language models (e.g. \cite{evans2024fast}) or MIDI (e.g. \cite{hawthornemulti}), and each model is trained on a collection of instrument sounds from the same instrument.  Specifically, we train models with different conditions on each of three open datasets to further enhance reproducibility: VocalSet \cite{wilkins2018vocalset}, Groove \cite{groove2019}, and GuitarSet \cite{xi2018guitarset}, which span vocals, and drums, and acoustic guitar, respectively.  We evaluate each model by applying it to the respective vocals, drums, and ``other'' stems in the MUSDB18-HQ dataset \cite{musdb18-hq}.  

Note that there are a lot of silences in individual traks, but this mirrors a more realistic scenario

Time spread echo hiding \cite{ko2005time}.  We use kernels that are designed to be more robust \cite{xiang2010effective}, but we find they don't work as well


\section{Background}

Explain RAVE and dance diffusion architectures

\section{Main Experiments}

Specifics on architectures, with number of parameters

\subsection{Audio format}
Every audio sample in the training sets is converted to a 44100hz mono 

We use dance diffusion with a 81920 sample size, which means the receptive field spans about 1.86 seconds.  As the authors of \cite{hawthornemulti} note, using a network trained with a smaller context to synthesize audio clips may result in audible timbre shifts from one section to another; however, this is fine for a proof of concept

\subsection{Single Echoes}

50, 75, 76, 100 for all instruments, plus percentage tagged for all models

\subsection{Pseudorandom Echo Sequences}



\section{Additional Use Cases}

\subsection{Dance Diffusion Fine Tuning}


\subsection{Rave Pitch Shift Augmentation}


\subsection{DDSP Reverb}


\subsection{Tagging Datasets}


\subsection{Demixing}



\section{Conclusion}
The conclusion goes here.
