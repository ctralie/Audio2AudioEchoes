	abstract = {Data hiding in media, including images, video, and audio, as well as in data files is currently of great interest both commercially, mainly for the protection of copyrighted digital media, and to the government and law enforcement in the context of information systems security and covert communications. In this paper we present a technique for inserting and recovering “hidden” data in audio files. In this technique the phase of chosen components of the host audio signal is manipulated in a way that may be detected by a receiver with the proper “key”. Without the key, the hidden data is undetectable, both aurally and via blind digital signal processing attacks. The method described is both aurally transparent and robust and can be applied to both analog and digital audio signals, the latter including uncompressed as well as compressed audio file formats such as {MP}3.},

	volume = {15},
	issn = {1558-7916},
	abstract = {A novel technique is proposed for data hiding in digital audio that exploits the low sensitivity of the human auditory system to phase distortion. Inaudible but controlled phase changes are introduced in the host audio using a set of allpass ﬁlters ({APFs}) with distinct parameters of allpass ﬁlters, i.e., pole-zero locations. The {APF} parameters are chosen to encode the embedding information. During the detection phase, the power spectrum of the audio data is estimated in the -plane away from the unit circle. The power spectrum is used to estimate {APF} pole locations, for information decoding. Experimental results show that the proposed data hiding scheme can effectively withstand standard data manipulation attacks. Moreover, the proposed scheme is shown to embed 5–8 times more data than the existing audio data hiding schemes while providing comparable perceptual performance and robustness.},
